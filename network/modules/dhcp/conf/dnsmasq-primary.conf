# On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
# even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
# requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of
# working even when interfaces come and go and change address. If you
# want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,
# uncomment this option. About the only time you may need this is when
# running another nameserver on the same machine.

# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need

# a lease time. If you have more than one network, you will need to
# repeat this for each network on which you want to supply DHCP
# service.
